## For 2023-2024 Term 1
According to the feedback from students in 2022-2023, I rewrite the materials for 2023-2024 Term 1. The contents are simplified and all compiled in only one pdf file (attached below). Students are highly encouraged to type the codes by themselves rather than copying mine so that they can quickly get familiar with R. But those who have difficulties in learning R coding can still refer to the old version of my tutorials. 

## For 2024-2025 Term 1
