# ECO3080 Machine Learning for Business
This is the coding session for ECO3080 Machine Learning for Business.

## 2024-2025 Fall
Students in 2024-2025 Fall are required to learn Python instead of R as an accompanying programming language. Thus, I directly borrow the materials (especially Jupytor notebook files) from ISLP for the tutorial sessions. Students can access ISLP (www.statlearning.com/resources-python) for data, sample codes, and other instructions. The following topics are covered:
* **Tutorial 1: Introduction to Python**
* **Tutorial 2: Linear Regression**
* **Tutorial 3: Classification**
* **Tutorial 4: Resampling Methods**
* **Tutorial 5: Linear Model Selection and Regularization**
* **Tutorial 6: Moving Beyond Linearity**
* **Tutorial 7: Tree-based Methods**
* **Tutorial 8: Deep Learning and Unsupervised Learning**

## 2023-2024 Fall
According to the feedback from students in 2022-2023 Fall, I rewrite the materials for 2023-2024 Fall. The contents are simplified and all compiled in only one PDF file which includes 5 chapters:
* Chapter 1: Starting with R
* Chapter 2: Basic Classification Methods
* Chapter 3: Introduction to Model Selection
* Chapter 4: Basic Tree-based Methods
* Chapter 5: Introduction to Deep Learning

*Students are highly encouraged to type the codes by themselves rather than copying mine so that they can quickly get familiar with R. But those who have difficulties can still refer to the old version of my tutorials.* 

## 2022-2023 Fall
Files with name "Tutorial 1"-"Tutorial 8" include R scripts, slides and supplementary data, covering topics:
* Tutorial 1: Basic Functions and Data Management 
* Tutorial 2: Plots, Charts, Graphs and Maps
* Tutorial 3: Linear Regression
* Tutorial 4: Logistic/Probit, LDA/QDA and KNN 
* Tutorial 5: Resampling and Model Selection
* Tutorial 6: Nonlinear Models
* Tutorial 7: Tree-based Methods
* Tutorial 8: Introductory Deep Learning
